# 10.css

A Windows 10 UI Library that is a direct fork of [XP.css](https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css). 
It preserves XP.css's structure, class naming, and approach while updating the visual style to match 
the Windows 10 UI design language.

## Features

- **Drop-in Replacement**: If you're already using XP.css, you can simply replace it with 10.css without changing any HTML markup
- **Dark Mode Support**: Includes built-in dark mode theming to match Windows 10's dark theme
- **No Dependencies**: Pure CSS implementation with no external dependencies
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any front-end framework or vanilla HTML
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining the Windows 10 look
